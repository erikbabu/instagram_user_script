Requirements
 - An instagram profile

Features
 - Gives an overview of your profile
 - Gives a list of all captions ever posted and number of likes for each post
 - Gives total number of likes received on instagram and average per post

Problems encountered
 - Instagram made changes to their API policy which made getting follower details quite difficult. Was initially meant to be a tool to show people that don't follow you back and vice versa.
